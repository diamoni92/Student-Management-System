A complete console-based project to manage students efficiently — built from scratch in C++ with file handling and sorting algorithms.

This project is not just another CRUD system — it’s a mini database where you can:

Manage student records

Persist data using files

Search & update details

Sort using Merge Sort

Perfect for beginners learning C++ and for those who want to practice file handling, sorting, and structured programming.
